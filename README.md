# Challenge Option 3
Create an app for the DroneDeploy platform. The app should provide a button on the data page that will create a PDF of the map shown. For example:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/af50irnf2mrzhua/Screenshot%202016-12-09%2014.44.51.png?dl=0

When the button is clicked it should download a PDF that contains an image of the map being view. See http://developer.dronedeploy.com ( http://developer.dronedeploy.com ) in particular how to access “Tiles”.

You will also need to sign-up for a free DroneDeploy account. Please submit a link to a Github repository contain the code for your solution. Readability and comments are taken into account too.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our coding challenge!
