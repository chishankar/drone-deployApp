# drone-deployApp
Many DroneDeploy users have shape files that represent location boundaries such as the perimeter of their farm.
 
Your job is to build an app on the DroneDeploy App Market to allow customers to import these files as drone flight plans.
 
Attached are four examples of shp files. 
 
If you desire you can use this javascript library to translate a shp file to json.

Here are the docs for building an app on the app market.

Please use our official app as an example.

Please attach a zip of your source code when your submission is complete.

# What is a shp file?
SHP is a file extension for a Shapefile shape format used in geographical information systems (GIS) software. SHP is short for "shape." 

A shape file contains geographical reference data as individual objects such as a street, a river, a landmark or a zip code area. Features exist as objects and their attributes within the SHP file. 

GIS is a computer-based technology composed of hardware, software and data that is used to capture, display and analyze spatial data information.

The SHP file format was developed by ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute) as a predominantly open specification to promote interoperability between its products and other GIS software products. SHP files open in many GIS programs.
